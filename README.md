# Required Readings
Reading List for CSCI 1302

## Reading 00

   Read and take thorough notes on the following:
   
   * [1302 Reference Variable Refresher](https://github.com/cs1302uga/cs1302-tutorials/blob/master/refresher/variables.md)
     
     Read the section titled "Reference Types Overview". For now, you can skip everything after Example 3 (unless you're curious!).
     This short reading addresses some misconceptions we've seen from students about prerequisite knowledge that we've seen in 
     past semesters. Please read it carefully and ask any related questions on Piazza.

## Reading 01
   
   You should complete one of the setup instructions provided below before you begin:

   * [MacOS Setup Instructions](https://github.com/cs1302uga/cs1302-exercises/blob/master/misc/MacOS.md)
   * [Windows 10 Setup Instructions](https://github.com/cs1302uga/cs1302-exercises/blob/master/misc/Windows10.md)

   Complete the setup instructions below for Odin:

   * [Odin Setup Instructions](https://github.com/cs1302uga/cs1302-exercises/blob/master/misc/OdinSetup.md)
   
   Read and take thorough notes on the following:

   Note: You are encouraged to try the commands mentioned in the reading using a local terminal in your terminal 
   emulator (set up in the previous step). Some of the file and directory structures assumed by the reading are 
   specific to the institution hosting the reading, however, the general commands will still work. You are always 
   encouraged to experiment. 

   * [An introduction to Unix](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/unixintro.html)
   * [Unix Tutorial One, Two, Three, and Four](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/)
      * In Tutorial Two, the instructions for 2.1 have you copy a file called science.txt. This file is not 
      available under the path provided by the tutorial. To partially mitigate this, we encourage you to download 
      the file into your home directory, then copy it from there:
      
      ```
      $ cd
      $ wget http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/science.txt
      $ cd ~/unixstuff
      $ cp ~/science.txt .
      ```
      
## Reading 02

   We recommend following along with the tutorials on odin instead of your local machine. If you haven't already 
   completed the [Odin setup tutorial](https://github.com/cs1302uga/cs1302-exercises/blob/master/misc/OdinSetup.md), 
   you should do so before continuing.

   **Note:** This reading teaches you how to write/modify source code and then compile and run it in a Unix environment. 
   To be successful in 1302, you need to master the concepts described in this reading as all future projects/exercises 
   depend on it.

   * [Emacs Tutorial](https://github.com/cs1302uga/cs1302-tutorials/blob/master/emacs/emacs.md)
   * [Emacs Reference Card](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/refcards/pdf/refcard.pdf) 
      * We recommend you print the Emacs reference card
   * [CSCI 1302 Package Tutorial](https://github.com/cs1302uga/cs1302-tutorials/blob/master/packages.md)
      * The 1302 Package Tutorial explains how to compile code in a UNIX environment.

## Reading 06

   Read and take thorough notes on the following:

   * [Java Interfaces Tutorial](https://github.com/cs1302uga/cs1302-tutorials/blob/master/interfaces/interfaces.md)
   
## Reading 07 
   **- CONSIDER CHANGING THIS - change to instead be an interface example with the Java List interface. Have them write a program 
   that uses the interface and then allow them to plug in different interface implementations (ArrayList, LinkedList) seamlessly. 
   The application could be a shopping list, for example. Would help the students see the driver program side early which might help
   them with project 2 (listadt).**

   latest commit in the branch as well as all commits that can be reached by tracing backward through the commit history 
   (even through branching points). When tracing a branch's history using the graphical log output (--graph), you should 
   not stop at the point where the branch name was created (or any other branching points).
