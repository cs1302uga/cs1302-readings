   Note: You are encouraged to try the commands mentioned in the reading using a local terminal in your terminal 
   emulator (set up in the previous step). Some of the file and directory structures assumed by the reading are 
   specific to the institution hosting the reading, however, the general commands will still work. You are always 
   encouraged to experiment.Â 

   * [An introduction to Unix](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/unixintro.html)
   * [Unix Tutorial One, Two, Three, and Four](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/)
      * In Tutorial Two, the instructions for 2.1 have you copy a file called science.txt. This file is not 
      available under the path provided by the tutorial. To partially mitigate this, we encourage you to download 
      the file into your home directory, then copy it from there:
      
      ```
      $ cd
      $ wget http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/science.txt
      $ cd ~/unixstuff
      $ cp ~/science.txt .
      ```
